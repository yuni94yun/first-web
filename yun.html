<p><a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled<br>
it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,</p>
<strong>injected humour and the like</strong>
<p><img src="image_1.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
